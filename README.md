## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Make sure Python is installed** on your computer
2. **Open a terminal/command prompt** in this directory
3. **Run any file** using:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
   
   For example:
   ```bash
   python 01_hello_world.py
   python 05_simple_calculator.py
   python 06_guess_the_number.py
   ```

## üìö Learning Path

**Start here if you're completely new to Python:**
1. `01_hello_world.py` - Basic concepts
2. `02_variables_and_data_types.py` - Understanding data
3. `03_control_flow.py` - Making decisions
4. `04_functions.py` - Code organization
5. `05_simple_calculator.py` - Putting it all together
6. `06_guess_the_number.py` - Fun with games
7. `07_to_do_list.py` - Real-world application

## üí° Tips for Learning

- **Run each file** and see what happens
- **Modify the code** - change values, add new features
- **Read the comments** - they explain what each line does
- **Experiment** - try different inputs and see the results
- **Practice** - write your own variations of these programs

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No additional packages required (all examples use built-in Python libraries)

## üéØ Next Steps

After completing these examples, you might want to explore:
- Object-oriented programming (classes and objects)
- Working with external libraries (like `requests` for web APIs)
- Data analysis with `pandas`
- Web development with `flask` or `django`
- GUI applications with `tkinter`

Happy coding! üêç‚ú®
